Container utilities
===================

The container-utils Python package contains utility functionality for working with Docker containers via the [Docker SDK for Python](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/). The core functionality was originally part of the [ue4-ci-helpers](https://github.com/adamrehn/ue4-ci-helpers) package, and was subsequently factored out into a standalone package that can be used with minimal dependencies.

To install the package, simply run: `pip3 install container-utils`
